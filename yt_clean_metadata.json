While its hypnotic rhythms are rather soothing, the vault vocals featured here from the late legend DJ Rashad contain venomous taunts at rival DJs. It\u2019s both a cold hearted diss to anybody making mid-grade tracks, and a glorious 4 minutes of sounds to smoke one to.\u00a0\n\n-\n\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",

Created almost two decades ago, this juke essential finally gets a proper release, this time alongside five brand new tracks. In addition to being an architect of the footwork sound since the late 90s, Spinn has always had a gift for creating club anthems that go beyond the circle. Possessing one of the most charismatic voices on the mic, his party chants get cut up just like his drums, riding waves of pulsating bass without sacrificing any of his rhythmic mastery. Whether at a warehouse on the South Side or a festival in Europe, Break Yo Back EP is a timeless party gem that will wrecked havoc worldwide.",

    "description": "http://teklife57.com/releases/018-TRAXMAN_TEKVISION_volume3/index.html\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",

A mastermind of meshing lush R&B auras with perplexing percussion as heard on his recent Signals in My Head album, here he plays with similar soothing chord progressions, but takes them in a more eerie rather than elegant direction. Serene, rather minimal sections of bass and synth and intermittent battle breakdowns are tied together by a gritty, serpentine lead that perfectly creeps through the track. One minute you\u2019re suspended in animation, the next you\u2019re in a wormhole. This wonderful bending of time and space is what footwork is all about, and Manny does it masterfully every time he touches the keys or the drum pads.",

    "description": "http://www.planet.mu/discography/ZIQ313\n\nThis three tracker from the aptly named 'Dream Continuum' is a collaboration between Travis Stewart a.k.a. Machinedrum and Jim Coles a.k.a. Om Unit, who was behind the Phillip D Kick 'footwork jungle' tracks in 2011.\n\nThe meeting came about when Travis and Jim realised they were working in parallel on the same concept of finding the sweet spot between mid-90's euphoric jungle and footwork, so naturally they set about working out how to find it together.\n\nThe 'Reworkz EP' moves backwards and forwards in time with 'Be Free' treating Jungle's diva samples with footwork pitch bending and repetition while adding huge uplifting chords that capture the euphoria of rave perfectly. It's then laid over tough, rolling 808 kicks and snares at 160bpm with a carpet of pumping, rhythmic sub-bass resulting in a new hybrid that is both fresh and energetic.\n\n'Give a Lil Luv' is, if anything, even more euphoric, like rolling thunder with an intense, melodic use of samples and chord stabs with metallic breaks building into a spiky mesh of rhythms.\n\nOn side B 'Set it' draws classic dancehall, soul and reggae samples across a perfect mix of fast juke cymbals and jungle amens, each part casually camouflaging the other, tempering footwork's sometimes intimidating sparseness and filling it with rich, warm and sincere rave energy.",

    "description": "http://teklife57.com/releases/018-TRAXMAN_TEKVISION_volume3/index.html\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",

    "description": "http://teklife57.com/releases/018-TRAXMAN_TEKVISION_volume3/index.html\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",

    "description": "Track written and produced by Kavain Space, copyright control.\nVideo by Jonathan Toomey.\n\nTaken from the album 'RP Boo - Legacy' (Planet Mu, May 2013)\nhttp://www.planet.mu/discography/ZIQ335\n\n01 Steamidity\n02 Invisibu Boogie!\n03 Red Hot\n04 There U'Go Boi\n05 Battle In The Jungle\n06 The Opponent\n07 187 Homicide\n08 Speakers R-4 (Sounds)\n09 Havoc Devastation\n10 No Return\n11 Robotbutizm\n12 Sentimental\n13 What'Cha-Gonna Du\n14 Area 72\n\nRP Boo -- a.k.a. Kavain Space is a man who is revered and respected amongst the dance music cognoscenti. He's cited as one of the originators of Footwork, the fast, repetitive, rhythmically syncopated music & dance style that's a grandchild of Chicago house and which has been brought to the wider world via releases from Planet Mu and others, alongside internet archaeology from fans, experts and enthusiasts.\u2028\u2028\n\nGoing back to the roots of this music, his self released track 'Baby Come On' made in 1997, sampled and looped up ODB over tough syncopated drums, and in doing so spawned one of the first tracks to solidify the style called Footwork. Later on, in 1999, his track known as '11-47-99' a.k.a. The Godzilla Track was monumental in the evolution of sampling in footwork, chopping up the Godzilla theme taken from 'Simon Says', by Pharoahe Monche and setting off a trend for footwork versions of hip-hop tracks. Many cite RP Boo as the originator of footwork music, and it's hard to argue, when the scrambled, syncopated drum patterns common to footwork can be largely traced back to him.\u2028\u2028\n\nKavain was born in West Chicago and moved to the Southside in the 80s. Like many of footwork's originators, he was brought through into production through associations with the legendary House and Juke dance clique House-O-Matics, DJing alongside DJ Deeon and DJ Milton, then getting shown how to produce by DJ Slugo. The machine Kavain learnt to produce on was a display model of the Roland R-70, a drum machine which gave access to all previous Roland drum sounds and the ability to punch in rhythms on the fly, it's the machine he still uses today.\n\n\u2028\u2028RP Boo's music is singular and unusual in Footwork, featuring raps and dialogue adopted from Juke, often in combination with sharp-edged and incidental samples giving some tracks a paranoid atmosphere. Take '187 Homicide's bleak feeling and question and answer vocals, 'Area 72's alien landing scenario or 'Speaker's R-4's audio walk-through. His music is often hectic, seemingly built to to almost psyche-out the listener or offer challenges to dancers; it's this playful and imaginative quality, along with his sometimes baffling-but-it-works rhythms and sub, that give RP's tracks their totally unique feel.",

Comprised of floating jazz chords and mellow movements, he once again explores the ethereal side of footwork on this lavish new single for the Teklife imprint. Well known for his mastery in this lane with countless sentimental tracks in his catalog, he flawlessly balances these sweet synths with deep rolling bass. The perfect amount of percussion is peppered on top, showing itself only when needed, putting the melodic elements front and center. Notorious for pairing anxious rhythms with saccharine harmonies, Manny has long been the master of romantic footwork, and here he once again reminds us how important R&B is to his sound.",

    "description": "http://www.teklife57.com/releases/021-DJ_LUCKY_RUPEES/index.html \nChicago underdog DJ Lucky brings us Rupees, his debut Teklife single featuring Las Vegas-based colleague Plain James. Stretching and slicing a soloist, the two make unpredictable moves with a vocal sample from bar to bar. Sustained notes glide over suspended 808s, then shatter into fragments following footwork percussion. Trance-inducing synths flutter into the mix, making everything even more hypnotic. It\u2019s the mould of a perfect battle track, eerie, erratic, and perfect for the most intense moments in the circle.",

Created almost two decades ago, this juke essential finally gets a proper release, this time alongside five brand new tracks. In addition to being an architect of the footwork sound since the late 90s, Spinn has always had a gift for creating club anthems that go beyond the circle. Possessing one of the most charismatic voices on the mic, his party chants get cut up just like his drums, riding waves of pulsating bass without sacrificing any of his rhythmic mastery. Whether at a warehouse on the South Side or a festival in Europe, Break Yo Back EP is a timeless party gem that will wrecked havoc worldwide.",

The track highlights Traxman\u2019s mastery of rhythmic complexity and his deep connection to Chicago\u2019s dance battles and street culture. As a mainstay of the Footwork scene since the early \u201990s, Traxman fuses raw ghetto house roots with a futuristic electronic edge in this release.\n\nFollowing the first single \u201cWhere G-Tits At,\u201d \u201cJAKME!!!!!!!!!\u201d further asserts Traxman\u2019s role in driving the genre forward, blending the pulse of the West Side with worldwide footwork influences. The release comes on the heels of his successful Asia tour and previews the full-length Tekvision Volume 4, a compelling continuation of his legacy in footwork music innovation.\n\n\u201cJAKME!!!!!!!!!\u201d is now streaming on Bandcamp and will also appear on Tekvision Volume 4 alongside other fresh cuts from one of Chicago\u2019s most legendary producers.\n\nFor press inquiries, interviews, and promo requests, please contact:\nPublicist Name \u2013 press@tekliferecords.com",

    "description": "http://www.teklife57.com/releases/038-TRAXMAN-TEKVISION_volume4/index.html\nChicago footwork pioneer Traxman returns with his brand-new single \u201cWHERE THA BIGG TITS AT (feat. purple passion)\u201d, the first glimpse of his forthcoming album Tekvision Vol. 4, set for release this November via Teklife Records. \u201cWHERE THA BIGG TITS AT (feat. purple passion)\u201d is a raw and electrifying cut that exemplifies Traxman\u2019s signature approach to footwork: dense percussive programming, deep bass pressure, and off-kilter vocal chops that ignite both headphones and dancefloors. Hard-edged yet playful, the track keeps true to the street-level spirit of Chicago\u2019s West Side while sounding unmistakably fresh for 2025.\n\nWith a legacy spanning from Ghetto House origins in the early \u201990s through groundbreaking releases like Da Mind of Traxman, Tekvision, and Pacman Juke, Traxman remains a key force in shaping the global trajectory of Juke and Footwork. \u201cWHERE THA BIGG TITS AT (feat. purple passion)\u201d continues this influence, standing as both a nod to the roots of dance battle culture and a sharp push into the next era of rhythm-driven electronic music.\n\nThe single arrives on the heels of Traxman\u2019s recent Asia tour, during which his live performances reaffirmed his enduring role as a cultural architect of footwork worldwide. Tekvision Vol. 4 will expand on the legacy of the series, delivering another set of uncompromising rhythms for dancers, DJs, and footwork fans who thrive on innovation.",

    "description": "http://teklife57.com/releases/018-TRAXMAN_TEKVISION_volume3/index.html\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",

Films \n\ud83c\udfb5 http://www.teklife57.com/releases/023-THE_ERA_FOOTWORK_CREW/index.html\n\nOne of the last decade's top artist groups in Chicago, The Era Footwork Collective, continues to push its art form to new levels, both in the circle and outside of it. They make visuals, design merchandise, and craft music for their lifestyle when they're not busy performing, organizing, or battling. They've paired up with Teklife Co-founder DJ Spinn and rhythmic mastermind Jana Rush to bring us \"Who Betta,\" a brand new cypher celebrating footwork culture. They pass the mic around to tell tales of Chicago and what's happening around them while boasting themselves up as they do with their feet in the circle. Over the years, people have tried to make a hybrid between juke/ footwork and rap work, some more successful than others. Instead of pushing the party image as most rappers have tried, The Era talks about what they know in their raps, and foot working in Chicago is something they know a lot about.\n\nStream / Download from \n\ud83c\udfb5  https://lnk.to/TheEraFootworkCrew_WhoBetta\n\nLabel : TEKLIFE RECORDS \nRelease Date: Friday February 9th 2024\nArtist: The Era Footwork Crew  \nCat No: TEKLIFE023",

    "description": "http://teklife57.com/releases/018-TRAXMAN_TEKVISION_volume3/index.html\nOG Chicago pioneer Traxman is back with a fresh new chapter of his Tekvision series. This third LP compiles ten more classics with that grimy yet funky flavor that the Westside\u2019s finest is best known for. Raw and original, these are hard lined footwork tracks in their purest form: confrontational, off kilter, and free of any unnecessary fluff. \n\nWhile known for his crate digging expertise and encyclopedic knowledge of soulful snippets, his darker, more sinister side is channelled for this project. On the opening track Beep Beep, the very first sibilance of a vocal is turned into a psychotic synth bleep, a technique he employs throughout the album using tiny fragments of sound to create mesmerizing, maniacal rhythms. Rather than crackly 70s crooners, most of the samples used here are rugged, taunting vocal chants, heard on the battle anthem Gone On Man!, and weed tune 4800 a Pound featuring the late legend DJ Rashad. Aggression is the main driving force behind most of the music, but mysterious melodies like the creeping piano arpeggios on Well Well are just as important to the overall intimidation expressed on this album. \n\nStripped down and straight out of the drum machine, these uncut sounds are the backbone of what makes footworkers move. They\u2019re in your face but with an undeniable grove, seeped in tradition that goes back generations through dance music history. An ambassador of his city and culture, Tekvision Vol 3 continues Traxman\u2019s decades-long exploration into the pulse of Chicago.",
